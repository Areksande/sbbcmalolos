                <p style="font-style: italic;">The Core value of leadership is humility. Discipleship is by gaining the trust of people and building a
                good relationship. Jesus Christ is the best example of being a leader.

                Luke 6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.<br><br> 
                
                Philippians 2:3-4<br>
                3 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better
                than themselves.

                26 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;
                27 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:
                28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom
                for many.<br><br>

                I. DEFINING CHURCH MINISTRIES<br>
                A. The “WHAT” of church Ministries<br>
                Ministry is not what you can get
                but what you can do for Christ. Ministry is not a job or a Sunday routine, it’s a privilege to be chosen
                and used by Jesus.<br><br>

                1. The Goal of Church Ministries.<br>
                Ephesians 4:12-13<br>
                12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of
                Christ:
                13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect
                man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:<br><br>

                - Church Ministries are all about
                equipping and furnishing [perfecting],<br>
                - Attendance to serving [work of the ministry],<br>
                - and growing and building up [edifying the body] until the whole body is completely measured up to the
                character and the person of Jesus Christ (may grow up into Him in all things).<br><br>

                Its platform of government is humble service.
                Its desire is to please the Lord,<br><br>

                the Head of the Church:
                - Its attitude is obedience to His will;<br>
                - Its motive is “By love, serve one another,”<br>
                - Its goal is to glorify God;<br>
                - Its mandate is the Great Commission;<br><br>
                and Its three most important purpose are:<br>
                -EVANGELISM (Soul-Winning)<br>
                -EDUCATION (Discipleship); and<br>
                -EDIFICATION (Worship)<br><br>
                2. The Premise of Church Ministries, The Church is:<br>
                i. RUN LIKE BUSINESS;<br>
                Running a business takes hard work, dedication, and commitment. Whether you’re just starting out on your
                own or have been running a business for a while, there are a few things you can do to set yourself and
                your business up for success<br><br>

                Legend:<br>
                > Business<br>
                > Ministry<br>
                > Hire the right team.<br>
                > in the ministry:<br>
                Pray, love, and teach that we may produce the right team<br><br>
                Success depends on having the right people in the right roles. The key is to build your team so that
                every person is working in their area of expertise. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution, so you have
                to identify your business or ministry’s specific needs. Think about the areas that need the most
                attention and whether bringing in a dedicated team member will help improve things overall.<br><br>

                > Have a personal advisory board.<br>
                > in the ministry You need:<br>
                -a model to inspire us<br>
                -a mentor to coach us<br>
                -a partner to assist us &<br>
                -a friend who brings out the best in us!<br><br>
                Especially in the early stages of business or ministry, you need people who you can trust to turn to for
                advice. Your personal advisory board can be made up of mentors, fellow worker or staff from other churches, and in select cases, family
                members.<br><br>
                >Perseverance is everything.<br>
                > in the ministry you need to have faith<br><br>
                In any business or ministry, there are many trials and tribulations amongst the successes. The key is to
                not let things get you down, but to instead take those challenges and use them to fuel your drive and
                desire. It takes perseverance to push through the challenges to come out on the other side and achieve
                success.<br><br>
                >Create a Business Plan<br>
                > in the ministry we have Mission and Vision,
                short term and long term goal.<br><br>

                Starting and growing a business or ministry is a complicated affair. Don't try to wing it. Create a plan
                to lay out your operations for the next few years and the steps you need to take to achieve your goals.<br>
                The plan will help keep you organized.<br>

                > Don't stop evolving<br>
                > in the ministry don’t stop learning and improving<br><br>
                Your strategy, your plan, your target achievements nothing is set in stone. The world is changing more
                and more rapidly each day.
                The best way to remain relevant is
                to keep your eyes open for changing tides,
                your mind open to new ideas
                and your skills in flexibility top-notch.<br><br>

                Notice: be careful for negotiable
                and non negotiable.<br><br>

                ii. TREATED LIKE A FAMILY;<br>

                - Try being more patient with each other.<br>
                - Watch your tone of voice.<br>
                - Treat each other like you want to be treated.<br>
                - Being generous with what you have<br>
                - Being honest with others<br>
                - Participating in teamwork whenever possible<br>
                - Love and respect each others
                Esp. The elders<br><br>

                1 Timothy 5:1-4
                1 Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;<br>
                2 The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.Of widows<br>
                3 Honour widows that are widows indeed.<br>
                4 But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite
                their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.<br><br>

                iii. TAUGHT LIKE A SCHOOL; and<br>

                iv. PREACHED TO LIKE A LIFE-SAVING STATION<br>
                Preparation is the key<br>
                 Prayer<br>
                 study time,<br>
                 meditation, conceptualization.<br>
                 Application<br>
                 Aiming for excellence<br><br>

                B. The “WHY” of the Church Ministries.<br>

                The Lord built His Church to be:<br>

                1. The Repository of divine truth:<br>

                2. The Recruitment agency for God’s kingdom;<br>

                3. The Responsible agency

                to carry out the divine mandate;<br>

                4. The Responding institution<br>

                to the helpless and hopeless;<br>

                5. The Revolutionary army

                for divine change; and<br>

                6. The Representative earthly institution
                of the heavenly kingdom.<br><br>
                C. The ‘HOW’ of the Church Ministries.<br>

                1. Methods taught by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself
                and the apostles;<br>
                2. Pastoral teachings and experiences; and<br>
                3. Scriptural methods and promotions.<br><br>

                D. The “WHEN” of Church Ministries.<br>
                The Church started during
                the personal earthly ministry
                of the Lord Jesus Christ
                and it will have its conclusion
                at the time of the Rapture.<br><br>

                The Church at present is now marching
                toward her Stability, Continuity and Maturity
                (Matthew 16:15-18)<br><br>

                E. The ‘WHO’ of the Church Ministries.<br>
                God put men and women
                into Church Ministries
                to serve all His divine purpose.
                He equips and prepares them
                with Godly virtues such as:<br><br>

                1. Maturity
                (1 Cor. 14:20; Ephesians 4:14-15; 1 Cor. 13:11)<br>

                2. Faithfulness
                (Luke 16:10-12; 2 Cor. 5:7; Det. 28)<br>

                3. Loyalty
                (1 Cor. 4:2; Proverbs 17:17)<br>

                4. Humility
                (James 4:6; Phil. 2:3-11; Luke 14:11) and<br>

                5. Efficiency
                (Eph. 5:15-17; Luke 14:28; Psalms 90:12)<br><br>

                APPLICATION:<br>

                The ministries as church composite
                are designed to provide
                opportunities and avenues
                for spiritual growth and maturity
                of every believer.<br>

                If you are serving the Lord faithfully
                in one or two ministries here in our church,
                I want you to know
                that they can be your source of joy, strength,
                honor and fulfillment.<br>

                And every faithful service that you do for the Lord
                will surely be rewarded.<br>

                It’s all worth serving God
                in loving obedience and response
                to what Christ has done for you and me.<br>
                The Lord says that His Father will honor
                the one who serves Him<br>

                1 Peter 4:10
                As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the
                manifold grace of God.<br><br>

                Ephesians 3:21
                Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.<br><br>

                1 Corinthians 15:58
                Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,
                forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.<br><br>

                John 12:26
                If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve
                me, him will my Father honour.<br><br>
