                God gives us both a gift and a test. A new season does not only bring new opportunities
                it also reveals our integrity, our honesty, and our commitment to walk in God’s will.
                As we step into this new season the Lord has given us, the question is not only where God is leading us,
                but how we will walk with Him.<br>

                The Bible reminds us that walking in God’s will requires more than words it requires a life anchored in
                integrity and strengthened by commitment.

                <p class="main" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">THE PRESSURE OF A NEW SEASON</p>
                Every new season tests our integrity.<br><br>

                <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold; ">The Pain of the Season</p>

                Job experienced deep loss his family, his livelihood, and his health were taken from him. New seasons
                often come after loss, change, or shaking. God allows pressure not to destroy us, but to reveal what is
                within us.<br>
                <br>

                <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold; ">The Persuasion in the Season</p>

                Job’s wife urged him to abandon his integrity:
                “Curse God, and die.” In seasons of pressure, voices will rise
                that encourage compromise, bitterness, or withdrawal from God.
                <br><br>

                <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold; ">The Position of Faith in the Season</p>
                Job stood firm. He remembered God’s goodness and declared, “Shall we receive good at the hand of God,
                and shall we not receive evil?” In all this, Job did not sin with his lips. Integrity is choosing
                faithfulness even when circumstances are unfavorable.<br><br>



                <p class="main" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">THE PRINCIPLES THAT SUSTAIN THE SEASON</p>

                <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold;">Honesty Builds Character</p>

                Faithfulness in small things develops godly character.
                Honest stewardship invites greater responsibility from God.
                <br><br>

                <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold;">Honesty Brings Maturity</p>

                Spiritual growth happens when truth is spoken in love.
                Honesty before God and others helps us grow into Christ.
                <br><br>

                <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold; ">Honesty Brings Security</p>

                The upright are delivered by righteousness.
                A life of honesty brings peace, protection, and stability.
                When trust is high, influence is high;
                when trust is low, influence is low.
